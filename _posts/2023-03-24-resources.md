In my first post, I mention *Algorithms* by Jeff Erickson. This post will reflect some of the books and videos I've watched in college and beyond. However, I will credit most of my learning to work experience - after all, the best way to learn how to code is to code.

## Algorithms

* [Algorithms](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/), by Jeff Erickson
* [Algorithm Design](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358/) by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos. This was the book that was recommended to us for EE 360C, the algorithms course I took at UT.
* I haven't read the entirety of the [Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science/dp/3030542556/), by Steven S. Skiena but I have heard good things about it. You can watch the lectures for his Algorithms course from Fall 2020 [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx). 
* No algorithms list is incomplete without the slightly infamous [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/), by CLRS but I wouldn't recommend it as a first or even a second book to read. It is a great index, however.

## Operating Systems

I will only recommend [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. This book is wonderful. I have read this book cover to cover and genuinely enjoy reading it.

## Programming

* [Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits & Gates to C/C++ & Beyond](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computing-Systems-Gates-Beyond-dp-1260150534/dp/1260150534/). 

I have had the pleasure of taking a class by Yale Patt. It was the most difficult course I've taken in my life but one thing I genuinely appreciated were the tests. One thing I found at UT was that in science courses (I took introduction biochemistry, half a semester of organic chemistry, and biology) were that the tests weren't that bad - they tested if you *knew* the material. The tests in Computer Architecture tested if you could *apply* the material, which is a skill which I still use today. 

 The class I took was an upper graduate course (involving designing something rather similar to the LC3 in the book). 

* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen Downey is great for learning Python, even with no programming experience

## Compilers

Similar to OSTEP, I would only recommend [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. Another truly beautiful book. I have worked through the first 9 chapters and enjoyed them quite a bit. I hope to eventually create Clox in Rust.

## Not Computer Science

If you're interested in data science, I'd like to recommend [this list](https://sgfin.github.io/learning-resources/), from Sam Finlayson.

In my formal college experience, I have also had the pleasure of taking some biology courses. If you would like to learn about introductory biology, I'd like to recommend [Campbell's Biology](https://www.amazon.com/Campbell-Biology-11th-Lisa-Urry/dp/0134093410). After learning about introductory biology, you could proceed to learn about genetics (a truly fascinating subject), with [Genetics: From Genes to Genomes](https://www.amazon.com/Genetics-Genomes-International-Michael-Goldberg-dp-1260575829/dp/1260575829/). I took a genetics course from one of the author's, Janice Fischer, and can happily say I pointed out a few typos from the 6th edition for extra credit.
