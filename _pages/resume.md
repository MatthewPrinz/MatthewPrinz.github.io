## Experience

**Software Engineer 2, Amazon.com Inc** June 2024 - Current

**Software Engineer, Amazon.com Inc** June 2022 - June 2024

* Upgraded Spark application to increase fidelity of precomputed audience size from 24 hours to 1 hour using incremental data on AWS Step Functions and EMR
* Onboarded Spark cache loader to AWS Step Functions due to AWS Data Pipeline deprecation 
* Developed REST API for Amazon Ads audience creation backed by Fargate and DynamoDB, deployed through AWS CDK on CloudFormation using a CI/CD pipeline with onebox deployment, JUnit unit tests, and end-to-end integration testing


**Software Engineer, L3Harris Technologies Inc** June 2021 - June 2022		     

*Team: Mission Communication Systems Products*						     
* Extended rework of the User Admin panel by adding warnings, errors, and features that supported adding passengers alongside bug fixes and performance improvements

* Enhanced user experience of the WiFi panel by adding a scrollbar and clarifying capabilities of networks
